# Scope

In Scope (MVP)
	•	MR → RFQ → Quote Approval → PR → PO workflows.
	•	Supplier management & item master.
	•	Admin-configurable MR fields.
	•	Role-based access control (RBAC) & project authorization matrices.
	•	Audit logs, notifications, and attachments.
	•	Analytics dashboards (basic KPIs).
	•	Currency: AED (with admin-configurable USD conversion).
	•	Integrations: SSO, e-signature.
    •   Quote Approval is a required step. PRs and POs follow multi-step approvals as defined by project-specific authorization matrices

Out of Scope (MVP, Phase 2/Future)
	•	AI-powered supplier recommendations.
	•	Automated document parsing (RFQ/quote ingestion).
	•	Advanced analytics (savings dashboards, SLA tracking).
