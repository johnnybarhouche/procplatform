# Story 2.2: Global Layout & Navigation Refresh

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** procurement platform user,
**I want** a unified application shell with responsive navigation,
**so that** I can move between modules easily while experiencing the polished DSV-branded interface on every screen size.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement `AppLayout` with Deep Blue top bar, white page surface, and responsive nav (desktop sidebar + mobile bottom nav), consuming tokens from Story 1.2; keep the top bar and desktop sidebar fully affixed (no drift during scroll) and arrange the right-side controls in a single row ordered left→right as Project selector, Role selector, Notifications, User avatar. [Source: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout; docs/uiux/design-tokens.md]
2. Navigation items maintain state rules: unselected pills show white text on top bar, selected pills flip to white background with blue text, hover/focus states use tokenized colors, focus-visible styling meets accessibility guidelines, and sidebar typography is elevated to 18px labels with matching icon scale. [Source: docs/front-end.md#1-brand-guidelines]
3. Layout wraps all primary screens (MR, RFQ, Quote Approval, PR, PO, Supplier, Item, Analytics, Admin, UI Kit) with the updated responsive canvas rules: 176px fixed sidebar (overlay <1024px) that hugs nav labels, fluid content canvas with gutters of 8px ≤1280px, 12px at 1281–1440px, and 16px ≥1441px, headings aligning horizontally across sidebar + page content, and form clusters capped at 640px for readability. [Source: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout; docs/uiux/ui-gap-checklist.csv]
4. Navigation configuration is centralised with route metadata (label, icon, href, availability by role) and supports query-based route selection across desktop and mobile nav. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
5. Accessibility/responsiveness validated: keyboard traversal, ARIA attributes, contrast checks, and responsive behaviour at desktop/tablet/mobile recorded in Dev Notes along with lint outcome. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Build layout primitives (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create `src/components/layout/AppLayout`, `TopBar`, `SideNav`, `BottomNav` utilities using design tokens. [Source: docs/uiux/design-tokens.md]
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement nav state logic (default/hover/active/focus) to satisfy palette rules and ensure focus-visible styling. [Source: docs/front-end.md#1-brand-guidelines]
- [x] Task 2: Centralize navigation data (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Define nav configuration (label, icon, href, role visibility) in a single module, enabling reuse across layout. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Hook layout to router/query string so active nav is determined via `?view=` parameter; support UI Kit external route. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-gap-checklist.csv]
- [x] Task 3: Wrap application pages (AC: 3)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Update `src/app/page.tsx` to use `AppLayout`, refactor per-module content to remove duplicate nav/spacing wrappers. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Wrap `/ui-kit` showcase and ensure layout adoption across major dashboards (MR, Procurement, PR, etc.). [Source: docs/uiux/ui-gap-checklist.csv]
- [x] Task 4: Refine responsive behaviour (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Ensure sidebar collapses on <lg breakpoints and bottom nav provides quick access to MR, RFQ, PR, PO, Suppliers. [Source: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout]
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Verify spacing/typography tokens are applied uniformly post-wrap (white background, consistent `space-y-5`). [Source: docs/uiux/design-tokens.md]
- [x] Task 5: Validation & documentation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Run `npm run lint` and log any inherited failures (`@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`).
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Document accessibility testing (keyboard focus order, contrast, responsive screenshots) in Dev Notes; update `docs/uiux/ui-kit-notes.md` if layout guidance changes. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Stories 1.2 and 2.1 provide tokens and UI kit primitives; layout must consume them to avoid bespoke Tailwind fragments. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.design-tokens.story.md; docs/stories/2.1.ui-kit-development.story.md]
- Story 1.3 wireframes rely on this shell for annotations; ensure sections map 1:1 with design deliverables. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.wireframes-delivery.story.md]

### Action Items for Dev Team
- Re-validate sticky top bar + sidebar behaviour against updated AC1; reopen or file follow-up if current implementation scrolls with content.
- Adjust layout padding to the new 8px/12px/16px gutters, confirm sidebar typography/padding updates, and capture alignment screenshots at 1280px, 1440px, 1600px.

### Data Models
- None; layout handles navigation and presentation only.

### API Specifications
- No API calls changed; ensure existing screens continue to fetch data within the layout wrapper.

### Component Specifications
- Layout must support SPA/PWA requirements (responsive, accessible) and different roles (admin vs non-admin nav entries). [Source: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout]

### File Locations
- Layout: `src/components/layout/`. Page wrappers: `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/ui-kit/page.tsx`; dashboards under `src/components/` consume layout spacing classes.

### Testing Requirements
- Manual validation + lint run documented in Dev Notes.

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain DSV brand fidelity (Deep Blue header, white surface) and WCAG AA contrast targets.

### Project Structure Notes
- Keep nav definitions separate from layout components for extensibility; align with project architecture conventions.

## Testing

### Test File Location
- None required for layout; optional snapshot/RTL tests if added later.

### Test Standards
- `npm run lint` results logged.
- Manual accessibility/responsive checks recorded.

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Optional Jest + RTL for navigation behaviour.

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Capture screenshots across breakpoints demonstrating top bar, sidebar, and bottom nav states.

### Debug Log References
- `npm run lint` (fails: existing `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` rule in `jest.config.js`; warnings unchanged).
- Manual navigation accessibility checks (keyboard traversal, focus-visible, responsive states) noted in Dev Notes.
- 2025-02-14: Re-ran `npm run lint` after gutter updates; failures remain limited to the known legacy rules above.

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented `AppLayout`, `TopBar`, `SideNav`, and `BottomNav` using design tokens.
- Centralised navigation metadata with role visibility and query-based route selection.
- Wrapped home and UI kit routes (plus dashboards) in the shared layout with consistent spacing/background.
- Documented validation results (lint + accessibility/responsive checks).
