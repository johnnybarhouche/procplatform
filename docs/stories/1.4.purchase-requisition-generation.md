# Story 1.4: Purchase Requisition (PR) Generation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Procurement Manager,
**I want** to automatically generate Purchase Requisitions from approved quote packs,
**so that** I can create formal procurement requests that follow the project's authorization matrix and proceed to Purchase Order creation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System automatically generates PRs when quote approvals are completed
2. PRs are generated per supplier with approved line items grouped together
3. PRs include all required fields: PR number, project details, supplier information, line items, quantities, prices, and approval routing
4. PRs are routed through project-specific authorization matrix based on total value thresholds
5. PR status tracking includes: Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Approved → Rejected
6. Approvers can approve, reject, or add comments to PRs
7. Approved PRs automatically trigger PO generation workflow
8. Complete audit trail is maintained for all PR actions and approvals
9. PRs can be viewed, filtered, and searched by project, supplier, status, and date range
10. Email notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders for PR status changes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 (Quote Approval End User):
- The `QuoteApprovalForm` component handles line item decisions and approval workflow
- The `/api/quote-approvals/[id]` endpoint processes approval decisions and triggers PR creation
- The `QuoteApproval` and `LineItemDecision` entities track approval decisions
- Audit logging is implemented for all approval actions
- The system supports split awards (different suppliers for different line items)

### Data Model Highlights
- **Purchase Requisitions**: New entity to track formal procurement requests generated from approved quotes
- **PR Line Items**: Detailed line items grouped by supplier with quantities, prices, and approval status
- **Authorization Matrix**: Project-specific approval rules based on value thresholds and user roles
- **PR Approvals**: Tracking of approval workflow with approver assignments and decision history
- **Audit Logs**: Complete audit trail for all PR actions, approvals, and status changes

### API Specifications
- **POST /api/prs**:
  - **Purpose**: Generate new PRs from approved quote packs
  - **Request Body**: `quote_approval_id: string`, `project_id: string`
  - **Response**: Array of generated `PurchaseRequisition` objects
- **GET /api/prs**:
  - **Purpose**: Retrieve PRs with filtering and pagination
  - **Query Params**: `project_id?: string`, `supplier_id?: string`, `status?: string`, `page?: number`, `limit?: number`
  - **Response**: Paginated list of `PurchaseRequisition` objects
- **GET /api/prs/[id]**:
  - **Purpose**: Retrieve specific PR details including line items and approval history

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for PR generation engine and authorization matrix logic
- Unit tests for all PR API endpoints with proper error handling
- Integration tests for complete PR workflow from generation to approval
- E2E tests simulating approver workflow with different authorization levels
- Performance tests for PR generation with large quote packs
- Mock email service for notification testing

### Technical Constraints
- Continue using mock in-memory data for API routes for MVP
- Ensure all new components are client-side components (`'use client'`)
- Maintain existing TailwindCSS styling conventions
- Adhere to TypeScript best practices for type safety
- Implement proper error handling and validation for all API endpoints
- Follow existing audit logging patterns for all PR actions
