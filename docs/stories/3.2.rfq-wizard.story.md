# Story 3.2: RFQ Wizard

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** procurement officer,
**I want** a guided RFQ creation wizard with supplier intelligence,
**so that** I can turn approved material requests into RFQs quickly while selecting the best suppliers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Procurement inbox displays submitted MRs and allows grouping/selection of MR lines to start an RFQ wizard step. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq; docs/prd/user-flows.md]
2. Wizard includes a supplier suggestion panel (procurement-only) populated with historical supplier data and prices, while allowing manual supplier additions. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq; docs/prd/user-flows.md]
3. Wizard captures RFQ metadata (due date, terms), composes supplier packets, and dispatches tracked invitations or portal links via the existing notification queue email job. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq; docs/prd/user-flows.md]
4. RFQ entities persist in the data model (rfqs, rfq_suppliers, quotes, quote_lines) with state transitions aligned to the MR → RFQ workflow. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md; docs/architecture/workflow-handling.md]
5. Accessibility/responsiveness verified: keyboard traversal of wizard steps, focus-visible states, and responsive layout logged in Dev Notes. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3, 4) — RFQ metadata and dispatch flow
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Capture due date, incoterms/payment terms, and notes; map to `rfqs` rows when saving. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Generate supplier packets (lines + attachments) and trigger notification queue email dispatch (payload: supplierId, contact email, MR line bundle, due date, terms, attachments). [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq; docs/architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md]
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Persist supplier-level state in `rfq_suppliers` and initialize quote placeholders to feed the comparison grid. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 5) — Accessibility & responsiveness validation
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Verify keyboard traversal for wizard steps, supplier list, and action buttons; document results. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Capture responsive screenshots (desktop/tablet/mobile) and note contrast checks for panels. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]
- [x] Task 5 — Automated & manual testing
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Add/extend RTL tests covering MR line selection, supplier suggestion interactions, and dispatch confirmation. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq]
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Document regression steps ensuring RFQ state transitions feed comparison grid and downstream Quote Approval. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- MR form (Story 3.1) standardized token usage and validation patterns; reuse card spacing and input tokens to keep wizard UI consistent. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.material-request-form.story.md]

### Data Models
- RFQ domain spans `rfqs`, `rfq_suppliers`, `quotes`, and `quote_lines`; ensure wizard writes rows that align with these relationships. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- Maintain linkage between MR lines and RFQ entries so approvals can trace source demand. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]

### API Specifications
- RFQ dispatch integrates with existing notification queue/email template; payload includes supplier identifier, contact email, bundled MR lines, due date, terms, and attachments. Confirm backend template helper and notify service availability before implementation. [Source: architecture docs — confirm notification helper availability]

### Component Specifications
- Wizard steps: MR line selection → Supplier suggestions → Metadata → Dispatch per design spec. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq]
- Comparison grid depends on supplier/quote data produced by this wizard; ensure outputs match expected structure. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq]

### File Locations
- Architecture docs do not prescribe specific frontend directories for wizard components; follow existing feature folder conventions. [Source: architecture docs — confirm notification helper availability]

### Testing Requirements
- Accessibility focus-visible and keyboard traversal checks required for every wizard step. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]
- Regression must confirm MR → RFQ → Quote Approval workflow remains intact. [Source: docs/architecture/workflow-handling.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Frontend stack remains React + Tailwind SPA with role-based access; enforce procurement-only visibility for suggestions. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- Workflow engine manages MR → RFQ states; emit transitions compatible with centralized state machine. [Source: docs/architecture/workflow-handling.md]
- Notifications use async queue with DLQ fallback; dispatch logic should integrate with that pipeline. [Source: docs/architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md]

### Project Structure Notes
- No additional structure guidance found beyond existing layout patterns; follow `src/components` feature folders established in prior stories. [Source: architecture docs — confirm notification helper availability]

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Add or extend `src/__tests__/components/RFQWizard.test.tsx` (or equivalent) for wizard flows.

### Test Standards
- Jest + React Testing Library for component interactions; document accessibility checks alongside manual QA notes. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Use RTL user-event to simulate step progression, supplier selection, and dispatch confirmation dialogues. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq]

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Validate supplier suggestion ranks update when MR lines change.
- Confirm dispatch flow records notifications and initial quote placeholders for each supplier.
