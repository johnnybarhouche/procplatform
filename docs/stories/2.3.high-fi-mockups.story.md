# Story 2.3: High-Fidelity Mockups Delivery (Design)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Product Owner working with the design team,
**I want** high-fidelity mockups for the core layout and navigation,
**so that** development can implement pixel-perfect screens aligned with the refreshed design system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. High-fi mockups cover the global shell (top bar, sidebar, bottom nav) plus key flows (MR form, RFQ wizard summary, Quote Approval, PR dashboard, PO timeline) reflecting latest tokens/UI kit components. [Source: docs/front-end.md; docs/uiux/design-tokens.md; docs/uiux/ui-kit-notes.md]
2. Desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints are provided for each screen, demonstrating responsive behaviour (collapsed sidebar, bottom nav) and state variations (active nav pill, hover/focus states). [Source: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout]
3. Mockups include annotations for spacing, typography, component usage, and state interactions, referencing Story 1.2 tokens and Story 2.1 UI kit primitives. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.design-tokens.story.md; docs/stories/2.1.ui-kit-development.story.md]
4. Mockups are reviewed with Product Owner and engineering; feedback is incorporated and approval recorded in the story change log, with Figma links documented. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
5. Exported assets (PNG/PDF) are stored or linked (docs/uiux/mockups/), and the design-to-dev kick-off notes are updated. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Prepare mockup requirements (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Align with PO/eng on scope, referencing wireframes from Story 1.3 and layout expectations from Story 2.2. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.wireframes-delivery.story.md; docs/stories/2.2.global-layout-navigation.story.md]
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Confirm token and UI kit references to ensure mockups reflect naming/states accurately. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.design-tokens.story.md; docs/stories/2.1.ui-kit-development.story.md]
- [x] Task 2: Produce high-fidelity mockups (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Design global layout mockups (desktop/tablet/mobile) with annotated navigation states.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create high-fi screens for MR form, RFQ wizard summary, Quote Approval, PR dashboard, PO timeline showing real data examples and component usage.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Add annotations for spacing, typography, tokens, and interactive states.
- [x] Task 3: Review & approvals (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Conduct review session; capture feedback and iterate.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Record approval in change log with Figma link and summary of decisions.
- [x] Task 4: Asset delivery (AC: 5)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Export PNG/PDF versions and store under `docs/uiux/mockups/` or provide share links.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Update design-to-dev notes with pointers to mockups and any implementation caveats for developers.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.3 wireframes define layout/flow coverage; mockups should align with those structures. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.wireframes-delivery.story.md]
- Stories 1.2 & 2.1 define tokens and UI kit primitives; mockups must reference them to avoid ambiguity. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.design-tokens.story.md; docs/stories/2.1.ui-kit-development.story.md]

### Data Models
- No changes; focus on visual fidelity while ensuring entity relationships (MR → RFQ → Quote → PR → PO) remain clear.

### API Specifications
- None; ensure screens highlight data elements expected from APIs (statuses, totals, approvals).

### Component Specifications
- Use UI kit primitives for consistency (e.g., button states, badges, tables) and ensure responsive behaviours map to Story 2.2.

### File Locations
- Store exports/reference links under `docs/uiux/mockups/`; note Figma file in story documentation.

### Testing Requirements
- Not applicable (design deliverable); rely on review approval.

### Technical Constraints
- Ensure mockups meet DSV brand guidelines and accessible contrast levels (test key combinations in Figma).

### Project Structure Notes
- No code changes required; focus on documentation and design artefacts.

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Not applicable.

### Test Standards
- Review sign-off from PO + engineering.

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Not applicable.

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Record approvals, links, and any deviations from tokens/UI kit (if necessary) in story change log.
