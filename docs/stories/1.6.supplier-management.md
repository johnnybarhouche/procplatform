- Leverage the mock database approach for MVP
- Ensure robust error handling and audit logging for all supplier operations
- Adhere to the existing TypeScript type definitions and extend them as needed
- Implement role-based access control for supplier management actions
- Ensure compliance document security and proper file handling
- **Supplier Code Requirements**: Must be unique, auto-generated or user-provided, and displayed in all supplier interfaces
- **Contact Management**: Each contact must have Name, email, and phone number fields with proper validation
- **Usage Restrictions**: Suppliers cannot be deleted or modified if they have been used in any procurement transactions (MRs, RFQs, PRs, POs)
- **Contact Display**: When "View" button is pressed, all supplier contacts must be displayed with their complete information
