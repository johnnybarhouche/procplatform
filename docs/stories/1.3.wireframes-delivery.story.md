# Story 1.3: Wireframes Delivery (Design)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Product Owner collaborating with the design team,
**I want** low-fidelity wireframes for the MR → RFQ → Quote Approval → PR → PO flow,
**so that** the engineering team can implement screens with clarity while aligning to the agreed UX brief.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Design team produces low-fidelity wireframes covering Material Request form, RFQ wizard, Quote Approval, PR approver card, and PO timeline aligned to the UI/UX brief (`docs/front-end.md`). [Source: docs/front-end.md#3-core-user-flows]
2. Wireframes show desktop and responsive (tablet/mobile) variations for global layout elements (top bar, sidebar, bottom nav) and key interactions (state badges, attachments, traceability chips). [Source: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout; docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]
3. Screens include annotations for component states, data requirements, and navigation patterns, referencing the design tokens from Story 1.2 where applicable. [Source: docs/uiux/design-tokens.md]
4. Wireframes are reviewed with Product Owner and engineering, feedback is incorporated, and approval is recorded in the story change log along with final Figma/asset links. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
5. Exported wireframe artefacts (PDF/PNG) are stored in `docs/uiux/wireframes/` (or linked Figma project), and the delivery checklist is updated. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Gather requirements and UX notes (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Review the UI/UX design brief (`docs/front-end.md`) and audit findings to align on flow coverage and layout expectations. [Source: docs/front-end.md; docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Confirm scope with PO/engineering (modules, states, responsive variants) before wireframing. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
- [x] Task 2: Produce wireframes (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create low-fi wireframes for MR form, RFQ wizard, Quote Approval, PR approver card, and PO timeline, including annotations for statuses, interactions, and responsive behavior. [Source: docs/front-end.md; docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Highlight global layout elements (top bar, sidebar/bottom nav, traceability chips) and note component usage aligned with design tokens. [Source: docs/uiux/design-tokens.md]
- [x] Task 3: Review & approvals (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Conduct review session with PO and engineering to capture feedback and adjustments. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Update wireframes based on feedback and record approval in the story change log with final asset links. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
- [x] Task 4: Deliverables & documentation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Export wireframe artefacts (PDF/PNG) and store them under `docs/uiux/wireframes/` or provide Figma share links. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Update `docs/uiux/ui-kit-notes.md` (or delivery checklist) with location, version, and outstanding design tasks for downstream stories. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 (UI Audit) highlighted the need for consistent layout patterns and identified gaps to address in wireframes. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md]
- Story 1.2 (Design Tokens) defined the color, typography, and spacing tokens; wireframes should reflect token usage for components and states. [Source: docs/uiux/design-tokens.md]

### Data Models
- No schema changes; ensure wireframes capture key entities (MR > RFQ > Quote > PR > PO) and annotate data needs for each screen. [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md#data-model-highlights]

### API Specifications
- Reference workflow handling to ensure wireframes depict state transitions and approvals correctly. [Source: architecture/workflow-handling.md]

### Component Specifications
- Wireframes should align with DSV design guidelines (Deep Blue top bar, white surface, responsive nav). [Source: docs/front-end.md]

### File Locations
- Store deliverables in `docs/uiux/wireframes/` (create folder if needed) or link to shared Figma project noted in story documentation.

### Testing Requirements
- Not applicable for design deliverable; verification via approvals and checklist.

### Technical Constraints
- Ensure wireframes support responsive behaviors (desktop + mobile) and accessible patterns (focus, contrast) outlined in the design brief.

### Project Structure Notes
- No code changes required; focus on documentation and artefact handoff.

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Not applicable (design artefact).

### Test Standards
- Peer/PO review sign-off and documented asset links serve as validation.

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Not applicable.

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Record approvals and asset links in the story change log.
