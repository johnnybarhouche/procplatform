# Story 1.2: Procurement RFQ Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Procurement Officer,
**I want** to manage submitted Material Requests by creating RFQs, selecting suppliers, capturing quotes, and preparing quote packs for end user approval,

2. Supplier Suggestions Panel shows historical suppliers and prices (procurement-only)
3. RFQ creation allows grouping line items and selecting multiple suppliers
4. RFQ dispatch via tracked emails/portal links to selected suppliers
5. Quote capture supports manual entry and file upload
6. Comparison grid displays all received quotes side-by-side
7. Quote Pack submission to end user for mandatory approval
8. All actions are logged in audit trail

### Previous Story Insights
- Frontend components use React + TailwindCSS with responsive design [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- API endpoints follow Next.js API routes pattern with proper error handling [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- Database layer uses mock implementation with PostgreSQL schema ready [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- File upload functionality already implemented with validation [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- Audit logging system established for all operations [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]

### Data Models
- **RFQs**: rfqs → rfq_suppliers → quotes → quote_lines [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- **Suppliers**: suppliers + supplier_history for historical pricing [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- **Items**: items + item_prices for price tracking [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- **Approvals**: generic table covering MR, PR, PO, Quote Packs [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- **Audit logs**: actor, action, before/after JSON diffs [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- **Core tables**: projects, users, roles, suppliers, items, MRs, RFQs, quotes, PRs, POs, approvals, audit_logs, attachments [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.3]

### API Specifications
- **Backend Tech**: Node.js with NestJS (preferred over raw Express for modularity, dependency injection, Swagger API docs) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.2]
- **Architecture**: RESTful APIs [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.2]
- **Business Logic**: MR → RFQ → Quote → PR → PO transitions [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.2]
- **Authorization**: Role-based authorization (RBAC + ABAC) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.2]
- **Audit Logging**: Every action logged with timestamp, actor, before/after values [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.2]

### Component Specifications
- **Frontend Tech**: React + TailwindCSS + Headless UI (clean, lightweight, avoids CSS conflicts) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.1]
- **Design System**: Based on DSV corporate palette (Deep Blue, White, Black) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.1]
- **Architecture**: Single-Page Application (SPA), responsive design, PWA-enabled for mobile approvals [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.1]
- **Features**: Role-based dashboards (Requester, Procurement, Approver, Admin) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.1]
- **Modules**: MR form, RFQ management, Quote approval, PR/PO workflows, Supplier & Item management, Analytics [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.1]

### File Locations
- **Frontend**: React components in src/components/ directory
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes in src/app/api/ directory
- **Database**: Schema files in src/lib/ directory
- **Tests**: Test files co-located with source files using .test.ts/.spec.ts naming

### Testing Requirements
- **Test File Location**: Co-locate test files with source files
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- **Test Patterns**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for complete workflow
- **Testing Standards**: Follow existing patterns from Story 1.1 implementation

### Technical Constraints
- **MVP Tech Stack**: React frontend (PWA-enabled), Node.js/NestJS backend, Supabase Postgres with RLS [Source: architecture/mvp-vs-phase-2-tech-considerations.md]
- **File Storage**: Cloud object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Supabase storage) with presigned URLs (15-min expiry) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#1.4]
- **Security**: TLS, encryption at rest, signed URLs for file access [Source: architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md]
- **Auditability**: Immutable audit_logs table [Source: architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md]
- **Workflow Engine**: Lightweight service inside backend enforcing mandatory Quote Approval step [Source: architecture/workflow-handling.md]
- **State Machine**: All status enums managed in one config (draft, submitted, approved, rejected) [Source: architecture/workflow-handling.md]

### Project Structure Notes
No unified project structure document found in architecture docs. Using standard Next.js/React project structure with API routes pattern established in Story 1.1.
