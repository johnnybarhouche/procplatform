# Story 2.4: Authentication & Landing Experience Refresh

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** procurement platform user,
**I want** a secure, branded sign-in and project landing journey,
**so that** I can access the correct project with minimal friction while admins configure branding and roles during onboarding.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Sign-in page presents Username, Password, Remember Me toggle, and Request Access link, using enterprise tokens and responsive layout. [Source: docs/front-end.md#30-authentication-landing]
2. First-time sign-ins require an emailed one-time passcode (OTP) before any workspace access is granted; OTP validation locks out expired codes. [Source: docs/front-end.md#30-authentication-landing; docs/prd/user-flows.md#50-authentication-landing]
3. Post-login routing places users in the project tied to their account; multi-project users receive a selection step before entering the workspace. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#50-authentication-landing]
4. Request Access workflow captures name, company, email, phone, desired project, and justification, then notifies admins for review. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#50-authentication-landing]
5. Admin landing workspace exposes a project initiation wizard that captures project name, company logo upload, and initial role assignments, with the ability to revisit and adjust later. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#50-authentication-landing; docs/stories/1.9.admin-configuration-management.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Build authentication UI (AC: 1)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Implement sign-in form with Remember Me toggle and Request Access link following token spacing.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Handle error states (invalid credentials, locked account) with accessible messaging.
- [x] Task 2: Implement first-time OTP verification (AC: 2)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Generate and email OTP via notification service; store expiry metadata.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create OTP verification screen with retry limits and resend flow.
- [x] Task 3: Route users to project context (AC: 3)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Resolve project assignment from user profile and auto-route single-project users.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Provide multi-project selection modal with search/filter and recent projects.
- [x] Task 4: Request Access workflow (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Build request form capturing contact info and desired project; apply validation and rate limiting.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Notify admins via email/in-app tasks and persist pending requests for follow-up.
- [x] Task 5: Admin project initiation wizard (AC: 5)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Create wizard steps for project basics, logo upload (store object path), and initial role assignment.
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Allow admins to revisit the wizard to update branding or role assignments post-launch.

## Dev Notes
- Reuse existing notification infrastructure for OTP emails and admin alerts. [Source: docs/architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md]
- Leverage RBAC metadata to determine default project routing; rely on admin configuration story for project-role relationships. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- Ensure OTP payloads avoid storing raw codes—hash before persistence. [Security best practice]

## Data Models
- Extend `users` table with `default_project_id`, `last_project_id`, and `otp_hash` + `otp_expires_at` fields. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- Add `project_branding` table (project_id, logo_url, created_by, updated_at) or extend existing `projects` table with branding columns. [Source: docs/stories/1.9.admin-configuration-management.md]
- Persist `access_requests` (id, name, email, phone, company, requested_project, justification, status, reviewer_id, timestamps).

## API Specifications
- `POST /api/auth/login` — Authenticate credentials, initiate OTP when required.
- `POST /api/auth/otp/verify` — Validate OTP, mark account as verified, issue session token.
- `POST /api/auth/request-access` — Capture access request and notify admins.
- `GET /api/projects/assignments` — Return projects available to the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/admin/projects` / `PUT /api/admin/projects/{id}` — Project initiation wizard endpoints (delegated to Story 1.9 implementation).

## Component Specifications
- `SignInPage`: Form with Remember Me toggle, links to Request Access, error banners.
- `OtpChallenge`: OTP entry form, countdown timer, resend control.
- `ProjectSelectorModal`: Multi-project selection with search chips and recent badges.
- `RequestAccessForm`: Modal/route capturing intake fields, success confirmation state.
- `ProjectInitiationWizard`: Stepper for project basics, logo upload dropzone, role assignment grid.

## Testing Requirements
- Unit & integration tests for login, OTP verification, and access request APIs.
- Component tests covering Remember Me persistence, OTP retries, and project selection flows.
- Manual tests verifying OTP expiry handling, multi-project routing, and admin wizard updates.

## Technical Constraints
- OTP emails must be rate limited and expire within 10 minutes; lock account after 5 invalid attempts.
- Remember Me leverages httpOnly refresh tokens; never store credentials locally.
- Logo uploads stored in existing file storage bucket with validation on file size/type.
