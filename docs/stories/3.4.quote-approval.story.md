# Story 3.4: Quote Approval

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** project approver,
**I want** to review the RFQ comparison grid, choose winning suppliers per line, and confirm my decision,
**so that** procurement can only raise PRs after I complete quote approval.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Render a widened read-only comparison grid that mirrors RFQ pricing inputs (line description, invited suppliers, unit/total price, lead time, lowest-price highlight), surfaces recommendations, and removes the secondary right-side “Select Supplier” panel. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.3-quote-approval-end-user; docs/prd/user-flows.md#5.3-quote-approval-end-user]
2. Provide per-line supplier selection controls (radio buttons embedded within the grid) supporting split awards, displaying current savings deltas, and enforcing one selection per line before submission. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.3-quote-approval-end-user; docs/prd/user-flows.md#5.3-quote-approval-end-user]
3. Present a confirmation modal summarising line-level awards and requiring explicit acknowledgment before dispatch; cancel/confirm paths must be accessible and keyboard-navigable. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.3-quote-approval-end-user; docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md#23-quote-approval]
4. Persist approvals via the workflow engine so quote approval becomes a mandatory gate: submission records decisions per line, updates audit logs, and transitions the RFQ→PR state machine accordingly.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC 1) — Build quote approval viewer
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Reuse comparison grid data to render line, supplier, and pricing detail in a read-only table with lowest-price styling. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.3-quote-approval-end-user]
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Surface prior comparison selections and savings deltas in the summary pane fed by comparison grid outputs. [Source: docs/stories/3.3.comparison-grid.story.md; docs/prd/user-flows.md#5.3-quote-approval-end-user]
- [x] Task 2 (AC 2) — Implement award selection logic
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add per-line radio groups supporting split awards and block submission until each has a chosen supplier. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.3-quote-approval-end-user]
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Display line-level savings or variance messages once a supplier is picked. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-audit-report.md#23-quote-approval]
- [x] Task 3 (AC 3) — Confirmation & UX safety rails
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Implement a confirmation modal showing the award summary with cancel/confirm actions and keyboard focus traps. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.3-quote-approval-end-user]
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Provide status feedback (toast/banner) when approval is completed or cancelled. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-gap-checklist.csv]
- [x] Task 4 (AC 4) — Persist approvals & workflow handoff
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Extend quote approval API to record line decisions, update audit logs, and transition RFQ status to "quote_pack_sent" or equivalent. [Source: docs/architecture/workflow-handling.md]
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Ensure PR generation only triggers after all lines are approved; surface errors when workflow rejects incomplete submissions. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#5.3-quote-approval-end-user]

## Dev Notes
- Consume comparison summary data produced in Story 3.3 (`ComparisonGrid`) to pre-fill the quote approval view and avoid duplicating calculations.
- Align layout with global shell guidelines (top bar, sidebar) and apply existing UI kit components.
- Quote approval actions must remain idempotent—repeat submissions should not double-generate PRs; document API response contracts.
- Update audit logging to include per-line award changes for traceability.

## Testing
- Unit: React Testing Library coverage for selection state, validation blocks, confirmation modal interactions, and workflow calls.
- Integration: API tests ensuring quote approval endpoint persists decisions, writes audit entries, and rejects incomplete payloads.
- Manual: Validate keyboard navigation (tab/shift+tab), screen-reader labels on radios/modal, and full MR → RFQ → Quote Approval → PR handoff in staging.
