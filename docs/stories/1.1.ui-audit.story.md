# Story 1.1: UI Audit

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** UX lead for the procurement platform,
**I want** to audit the current MVP UI against the approved design brief and in-flight wireframes,
**so that** the team has a prioritized list of UX gaps to address before the updated UI/UX foundations go into development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An audit brief documents how each primary module (MR, RFQ, Quote Approval, PR, PO, Supplier Management, Item Database, Analytics, Admin) compares against the design spec, with annotated evidence highlighting compliance or gaps for navigation, layout, and key interactions. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3-core-user-flows]
2. A consolidated gap checklist is produced that prioritizes discrepancies by severity and by flow (MR → RFQ → PR → PO first), assigns an accountable owner (Design vs Dev), and specifies whether the fix needs wireframe, token, or implementation changes. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md; docs/front-end.md#3-core-user-flows]
3. Brand and design token compliance is evaluated for color palette, typography, spacing, and core components, capturing any mismatches from the DSV guidelines and documenting proposed remediation. [Source: docs/front-end.md#1-brand-guidelines; docs/front-end.md#6-deliverables-for-design-team]
4. Audit deliverables are reviewed with the Product Owner and design leads, feedback is incorporated, and approval to proceed into Sprint 1 execution is recorded in the story changelog.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Inventory current MVP UI versus design spec (AC: 1)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Capture annotated screenshots for MR, RFQ, Quote Approval, PR, PO, Supplier, Item, Analytics, and Admin modules, noting compliance with top bar, sidebar, and mobile nav expectations. [Source: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout; docs/front-end.md#3-core-user-flows]
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Document state coverage (draft/submitted, approval steps, attachments, timelines) for each module to flag missing UX states. [Source: docs/front-end.md#3-core-user-flows]
- [x] Task 2: Evaluate design tokens and foundations (AC: 3)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Audit color usage against the DSV palette, identifying off-brand hues across CTAs, alerts, and status chips. [Source: docs/front-end.md#1-brand-guidelines]
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Verify typography, spacing rhythm, and component baselines (buttons, tables, cards, modals) against the design deliverables list. [Source: docs/front-end.md#6-deliverables-for-design-team]
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Confirm  navigation scaffolding aligns with SPA + responsive expectations set for the frontend layer. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#11-frontend-ui-layer]
- [x] Task 3: Produce prioritized gap checklist (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Categorize findings by flow (MR → RFQ → PR → PO) and secondary modules, tagging the impacted user role per workflow handling guidance. [Source: architecture/workflow-handling.md#workflow-handling]
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Flag dependencies needing new design assets versus implementation changes, including required wireframes/mockups per module. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Record suggested remediation order focusing on foundational issues (tokens/UI kit/layout) before screen-level fixes. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
- [x] Task 4: Run review and secure approvals (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Walk through the audit and checklist with Product Owner and design leads, capturing decisions and action owners. [Source: docs/uiux-Implementation.md]
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Update the story changelog with approval notes and attach finalized artefacts in the shared repository/workspace.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No outstanding issues from prior stories block the UI audit; ensure the admin configuration area remains in scope during the review to keep system-wide navigation consistent. [Source: docs/stories/1.9.admin-configuration-management.md]

### Data Models
- Core procurement entities (MRs, RFQs, PRs, POs, suppliers, items, approvals) remain the backbone for UI auditing; ensure screens continue to represent these relationships clearly. [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md#data-model-highlights]

### API Specifications
- Workflow transitions (MR → RFQ → Quote → PR → PO) and approval routing are orchestrated through the centralized backend state machine; any UX gaps must respect the existing state model. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#12-backend-api-layer; architecture/workflow-handling.md#workflow-handling]

### Component Specifications
- Frontend stack uses React + TailwindCSS + Headless UI with a SPA, responsive, PWA-enabled architecture and DSV corporate palette; the audit should validate current UI matches these system foundations. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#11-frontend-ui-layer]

### File Locations
No specific project structure guidance is provided in architecture docs; document remediation notes using the prevailing file and module conventions already present in the repository.

### Testing Requirements
Architecture docs do not define automated testing standards for UI audits; treat acceptance criteria as the validation checklist and ensure reviewer approval is captured.

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain alignment with the MVP tech stack: React frontend, Node.js/NestJS backend, Supabase Postgres, and PWA-ready responsive layouts when assessing remediation impact. [Source: architecture/mvp-vs-phase-2-tech-considerations.md#mvp-vs-phase-2-tech-considerations]
- Preserve security expectations (role-based dashboards, audit logging) during the audit to avoid regressing cross-cutting concerns. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#11-frontend-ui-layer; architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md#15-authentication-authorization]

### Project Structure Notes
`docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` is unavailable, so no additional structure updates were validated as part of this audit story.

## Testing

### Test File Location
Manual artefacts stored under `docs/uiux` or shared design workspace; no automated test files required for this audit deliverable.

### Test Standards
Success validated via acceptance criteria sign-off and recorded approval from Product Owner and design leads.

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
Not applicable—manual review and checklist validation only.

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Verify each module’s audit notes include evidence (link or screenshot) and remediation owner.
- Ensure MR → RFQ → PR → PO flow has prioritized gap sequencing agreed with stakeholders.
