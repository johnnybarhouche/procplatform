# Story 3.3: Comparison Grid

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** procurement analyst,
**I want** a quote comparison grid that visualizes supplier offers per line item,
**so that** I can evaluate pricing and recommend suppliers before preparing the quote pack.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Render quote comparison grid with material request line items as rows and invited suppliers as columns, highlighting the lowest unit price per line in green. [Source: docs/front-end.md#32-procurement-rfq]
2. Populate each cell with quote details (unit price, total, lead time, attachments indicator) sourced from RFQ/quote data so procurement can inspect differences. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md; docs/prd/user-flows.md#52-procurement-rfq]
3. Provide procurement interactions to select recommended suppliers per line, surface savings deltas, and export a summary for the downstream quote-pack workflow. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#52-procurement-rfq; docs/front-end.md#33-quote-approval-end-user]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) — Build comparison grid component
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create responsive grid layout (rows = MR line items, columns = suppliers) with sticky headers and scroll support. [Source: docs/front-end.md#32-procurement-rfq]
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Apply pricing highlight rules (lowest unit price per line = brand-success token) with accessible legend. [Source: docs/front-end.md#32-procurement-rfq]
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) — Bind quote data to grid
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Map RFQ → quotes → quote_lines to populate pricing, lead time, and attachments indicators inline. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Add supplier column header metadata (total amount, response status) sourced from `rfq_suppliers`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) — Add procurement interactions and outputs
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Provide per-line supplier selection controls with savings delta calculations feeding quote-pack payload. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#52-procurement-rfq]
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Generate comparison summary export (JSON/CSV) for quote pack assembly and audit logging. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#52-procurement-rfq]
- [x] Task 4 (AC: 1–3) — Integrate into procurement workflow
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Embed grid within procurement dashboard/quote pack flow, respecting role gating for procurement users. [Source: docs/front-end.md#32-procurement-rfq; docs/architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Persist user selections and summary data to RFQ/quote records for quote approval handoff. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- [x] Task 5 (AC: all) — Validation and audit
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Log comparison actions (selection changes, exports) to audit trail aligned with workflow engine requirements. [Source: docs/architecture/workflow-handling.md]
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Document accessibility + responsive verification in Dev Notes (keyboard navigation, color contrast). [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.1 established MR form token usage; reuse card spacing, table styles, and validation patterns for grid filters. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.material-request-form.story.md]
- Story 3.2 (RFQ wizard) supplies selected suppliers, due dates, and dispatch metadata; grid must consume RFQ/quote records generated there. [Source: docs/stories/3.2.rfq-wizard.story.md]

### Data Models
- RFQ hierarchy (`rfqs` → `rfq_suppliers` → `quotes` → `quote_lines`) carries supplier pricing and status for each MR line. [Source: docs/architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- Core procurement tables (`mrs`, `quotes`, `audit_logs`) must be updated to reflect comparison activity and selections. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]

### API Specifications
- Backend exposes RESTful endpoints (NestJS/Next.js) for RFQs and quotes; grid should read via existing APIs or new endpoints aligned with MR → RFQ workflow. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md; docs/prd/user-flows.md#52-procurement-rfq]
- State transitions remain orchestrated by workflow engine; mark selections so Quote Approval step receives recommended suppliers. [Source: docs/architecture/workflow-handling.md]

### Component Specifications
- Follow SPA layout conventions (React + Tailwind, Headless UI) with role-based gating for procurement. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- Grid must support keyboard navigation, sticky headers, and responsive breakpoint behavior matching DSV design language. [Source: docs/front-end.md#32-procurement-rfq; docs/front-end.md#33-quote-approval-end-user]

### File Locations
- UI components live under `src/components/`; place grid in procurement module (e.g., `src/components/ComparisonGrid.tsx`) with shared hooks/utilities alongside existing RFQ components. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- Backend handlers belong under `src/app/api/` (e.g., `/quotes`, `/rfqs/{id}/compare`) aligning with current Next.js route structure. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.procurement-rfq-management.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for grid interactions (selection toggles, highlighting, exports). [Source: docs/stories/1.2.procurement-rfq-management.md]
- Validate keyboard traversal, focus rings, and color contrast per accessibility standards. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]
- Ensure end-to-end workflow integration (RFQ → comparison → quote pack) in regression plan. [Source: docs/prd/user-flows.md#52-procurement-rfq]

## Testing

### Test File Location
- `src/__tests__/components/ComparisonGrid.test.tsx`

### Test Standards
- Jest + React Testing Library for component-level verification; document manual accessibility checks in Dev Notes. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- RTL user-event for selection toggles, filtering, and export actions; mock RFQ/quote data via factory helpers. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.procurement-rfq-management.md]

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Assert lowest-price highlighting logic and savings calculations per line.
- Verify selected suppliers persist and propagate to quote-pack payload/export.
