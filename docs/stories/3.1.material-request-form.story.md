# Story 3.1: Material Request (MR) Form Refresh

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** materials requester,
**I want** the MR form to match the finalized high-fidelity design and token system,
**so that** I can create requests quickly with a clear, consistent, and responsive experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement the MR form UI per Story 2.3 mockups: white surface, Deep Blue (`#002664`) header treatment, token-driven spacing/typography, updated line-item table, and attachments module (desktop/tablet/mobile). [Source: docs/front-end.md#3.1-material-request-mr; docs/uiux/mockups/README.md]
2. Line items table uses UI kit primitives (Table, Select, Input, Badge) for token-based styling, with responsive stack on tablet/mobile and visible validation states (error, focus). [Source: docs/stories/2.1.ui-kit-development.story.md; docs/uiux/ui-kit-notes.md]
3. Attachments component supports per-line and MR-level uploads with thumbnail list, remove action, and status badges (pending upload, uploaded) using `status-*` tokens. [Source: docs/uiux/ui-gap-checklist.csv; docs/uiux/mockups/README.md]
4. Form-level validation matches mockups: required field messaging, disabled CTA states until form valid, focus-visible outlines (`focus:ring-brand-primary`), and inline helper text. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.design-tokens.story.md]
5. Accessibility checks: keyboard navigation through inputs/actions, screen-reader labels for controls (project selector, add/remove line item, file upload), and contrast meeting WCAG AA recorded in Dev Notes. [Source: docs/front-end.md#5-accessibility]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Align with design artefacts (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Review high-fi mockups (`docs/uiux/mockups/README.md`) and confirm responsive specs with design.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Note token/kit references (colors, spacing, components) to avoid custom Tailwind classes.
- [x] Task 2: Update MR form layout (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Refactor top section (project selector, summary) to use UI kit `Card`, `Select`, and token spacing.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Replace existing line-item table with UI kit `Table`, `Input`, `Select`, `Badge`, supporting add/remove actions and responsive behaviour.
- [x] Task 3: Implement attachments enhancements (AC: 3)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Add token-styled attachments grid/list with thumbnail, filename, and status badge.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Support per-line attachments (linking to line item) and MR-level attachments with remove action + focus states.
- [x] Task 4: Validation & interactions (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Wire form validation (required fields, numeric quantity > 0) showing inline errors and disabling submit until valid.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Ensure keyboard focus order, ARIA labels, and contrast meet requirements; log results in Dev Notes.
- [x] Task 5: Testing & documentation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Run targeted unit/component tests (if present) or add new tests for form interactions.
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Capture before/after screenshots (desktop/tablet/mobile) and update Story Change Log + mockup checklist if discrepancies arise.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.2 tokens and Story 2.1 UI kit components must be reused; avoid bespoke Tailwind utilities. [Source: docs/stories/1.2.design-tokens.story.md; docs/stories/2.1.ui-kit-development.story.md]
- Story 2.2 layout enforces `AppLayout`; MR form should assume it is wrapped and only manage internal spacing. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.global-layout-navigation.story.md]
- Wireframes from Story 1.3 provide content structure; high-fi mockups refine visuals. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.wireframes-delivery.story.md]

### Data Models
- No schema changes. Ensure line items maintain existing structure (id, itemCode, description, etc.) and attachments metadata remains compatible with API expectations. [Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md#data-model-highlights]

### API Specifications
- Form continues to call existing MR API endpoints; ensure new UI states map to current payload (attachments array, line items).

### Component Specifications
- Use UI kit primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Table`, `Badge`) and token utilities for styling.
- Responsive behaviour: table collapses to stacked cards below `md`, attachments switch to grid/list per mockups.

### File Locations
- Primary: `src/components/MaterialRequestForm.tsx`, attachments helper components if any (`src/components/ItemPicker.tsx`, etc.).
- Update tests in `src/__tests__/components/MaterialRequestForm.test.tsx` (if present) or create new ones alongside component.

### Testing Requirements
- Manual QA: keyboard nav, focus-visible, screen-reader labels, contrast (use Stark/axe).
- Automated: existing tests updated/passing; consider adding snapshot/RTL tests for attachments interactions.

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain PWA responsiveness and token usage; ensure no regression in file-upload functionality (per existing API contract).

### Project Structure Notes
- Keep attachments logic co-located; consider creating `AttachmentBadge` helper if complexity grows.

## Testing

### Test File Location
- `src/__tests__/components/MaterialRequestForm.test.tsx` (update or add coverage).

### Test Standards
- Jest + React Testing Library for form interactions.
- Manual accessibility audit recorded in Dev Notes.

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- React Testing Library user-event flows for add/remove line item, validation states, attachment upload handling.

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Confirm disabled submit state until required fields filled.
- Verify per-line attachment removal does not affect other entries.
