# Story 1.3: Quote Approval (End User)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** End User (Requester),
**I want** to review and approve quote comparisons for my Material Requests,
**so that** I can select the best suppliers and authorize procurement to proceed with Purchase Requisitions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. End user receives notification when quote pack is ready for approval
2. Quote comparison grid displays all received quotes side-by-side with key metrics
3. End user can approve/reject individual line items or entire quotes
4. Split awards are supported - different suppliers can be selected for different line items
5. Approval decisions are logged with timestamp and user identity
6. Approved line items automatically proceed to PR creation workflow
7. Rejected items return to procurement for re-quoting or cancellation
8. End user can add comments/justifications for approval decisions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 (Procurement RFQ Management):
- Quote comparison grid already implemented in `QuoteComparisonGrid.tsx`
- Quote pack creation system in place with `QuotePackForm.tsx`
- API endpoints for quotes and quote packs established
- TypeScript types for procurement entities defined in `src/types/procurement.ts`
- Role-based access control implemented for procurement users
- Audit logging system established for all procurement operations

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-model-highlights.md]
- Quote approvals: `quote_approvals` table with line item granularity
- Approval decisions: Generic approval table covering MR, PR, PO, Quote Packs
- Audit logs: Actor, action, before/after JSON diffs for all approval decisions
- Workflow state: All status enums managed in one config (draft, submitted, approved, rejected)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- RESTful APIs using Node.js with NestJS for modularity and dependency injection
- Role-based authorization (RBAC + ABAC) for end user access control
- Approval routing and status management via centralized state machine
- Integration endpoints for notifications and workflow transitions

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- React + TailwindCSS + Headless UI for clean, lightweight design
- Role-based dashboards with end user approval interface
- Responsive design with PWA-enabled mobile approvals
- Multi-project support with project-specific authorization matrix

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- Frontend components: `src/components/QuoteApprovalDashboard.tsx`
- API routes: `src/app/api/quote-approvals/route.ts`
- TypeScript types: Extend `src/types/procurement.ts`
- Database schema: `src/lib/database-schema.sql`
- Testing: `src/components/QuoteApprovalDashboard.test.tsx`, `src/app/api/quote-approvals/route.test.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture-layers.md]
- Unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library
- API endpoint testing with mock data and error scenarios
- Integration tests for approval workflow transitions
- E2E tests for complete user journey from quote pack to PR creation
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/` and component-specific `.test.tsx` files

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/workflow-handling.md]
- Workflow engine enforces mandatory Quote Approval step
- State machine: All status enums managed in one config
- Approval matrix: Driven by project policies, thresholds, and roles
- Transitions: MR → RFQ → Quote → PR orchestrated centrally

### Testing
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- **API Testing**: Unit tests for all approval workflow endpoints
- **Integration Testing**: Approval to PR creation workflow
- **E2E Testing**: Complete user journey from notification to PR creation
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/` and component-specific test files
- **Mock Data**: Use existing procurement mock data from previous stories
