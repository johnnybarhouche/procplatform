üìë UI/UX Design Brief ‚Äî Procurement Application

1. Brand Guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Primary Colors (DSV Corporate):
	‚Ä¢	Deep Blue #002664 ‚Üí use for headers, primary CTAs, and nav background.
	‚Ä¢	White #FFFFFF ‚Üí main content background.
	‚Ä¢	Black #000000 ‚Üí primary text and key accents.
	‚Ä¢	Secondary Palette: Use sparingly (status chips, alerts, highlights).
	‚Ä¢	Green (#00682A) ‚Üí Approved / Success states.
	‚Ä¢	Orange/Amber (#C64801, #FFC40C) ‚Üí Pending, warnings.
	‚Ä¢	Red (#E18375) ‚Üí Rejected, errors.
	‚Ä¢	Typography: Sans-serif (corporate-approved; fallback: Arial/Roboto).
	‚Ä¢	Tone: Clean, minimal, enterprise-grade.

2. Global Layout
	‚Ä¢	Top Bar (persistent):
	‚Ä¢	Left: Company logo uploaded during project initiation alongside the active project name (replaces the ‚ÄúGlobal Operations‚Äù placeholder).
	‚Ä¢	Right cluster ordered left‚Üíright as: role indicator (bold, non-interactive), notifications bell, and user initials avatar that opens the profile menu (update name, email, phone number, address, designation). All controls live on a single baseline with the project title.
	‚Ä¢	Background: Deep Blue #002664, text/icons White.
	‚Ä¢	Pinned to top (position: sticky/fixed) so global controls remain visible; apply subtle shadow when content scrolls beneath and keep the bar height constant so the nav offset never drifts.
	‚Ä¢	Spacing to canvas mirrors horizontal gutters: 8px ‚â§1280px, 12px at 1281‚Äì1440px, 16px ‚â•1441px so headings align with sidebar labels across every page; enforce perfect vertical alignment across logo, title, and right-side controls.
	‚Ä¢	Left Navigation (desktop):
	‚Ä¢	Background: White.
	‚Ä¢	Active item: Blue highlight bar, bold text.
	‚Ä¢	Items: Dashboard, MRs, RFQs, PRs, POs, Suppliers, Items, Analytics, Admin.
	‚Ä¢	Column width trimmed to 176px with balanced 8px horizontal padding so icons + labels stay visually centered; sticky offset mirrors the top bar gap and eliminates drift.
	‚Ä¢	Typography: 18px (Tailwind `text-lg`) labels paired with `text-xl` icons and 8px horizontal padding for a balanced stack; buttons fill the column width for consistent alignment.
	‚Ä¢	Nav supports its own internal scroll if menu height exceeds viewport while remaining visually pinned relative to page headings.
	‚Ä¢	Mobile Navigation:
	‚Ä¢	Collapsible sidebar ‚Üí Bottom tab bar for core modules.
	‚Ä¢	Content Canvas (responsive):
	‚Ä¢	Desktop sidebar stays fixed at 188px; below 1024px it converts to an overlay drawer.
	‚Ä¢	Canvas is fluid‚Äîno wide-mode toggle‚Äîwith side gutters set to 8px ‚â§1280px, 12px at 1281‚Äì1440px, and 16px ‚â•1441px; headings align horizontally with sidebar labels using matching top margins.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain at least 16px breathing room on phones; larger viewports follow the gutter values above.
	‚Ä¢	Tables and analytics stretch with the viewport while individual form clusters cap at 640px for readability; primary page titles share the same baseline as the first sidebar item.

3. Core User Flows

3.0 Authentication & Landing
	‚Ä¢	Sign-in page collects Username, Password, and a Request Access CTA alongside a Remember Me toggle; styling follows enterprise tokens.
	‚Ä¢	First-time sign-ins trigger a one-time passcode emailed to the user; the session remains inactive until the OTP is validated. OTP input supports six-character entry, countdown timer, resend, and inline error messaging for expired codes.
	‚Ä¢	Successful authentication routes users into the project mapped to their username; multi-project users choose from authorised projects after login, with a searchable modal listing recent projects.
	‚Ä¢	Request Access workflow captures name, email, phone, company, desired project, and justification; confirmation toast plus email notification route requests to admins for approval.
	‚Ä¢	Remember Me toggle drives cookie duration (30 days) and surfaces a ‚Äúpublic device?‚Äù helper label to discourage use on shared machines.
	‚Ä¢	Admin landing workspace provides a project initiation wizard to capture project name, upload the company logo, define default currency, and assign initial roles; admins can revisit to adjust roles later and preview branding on the top bar.
