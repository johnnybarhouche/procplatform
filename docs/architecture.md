üåê Final Architecture Document ‚Äî Procurement Application

1. High-Level Architecture Layers

1.1 Frontend (UI Layer)
	‚Ä¢	Tech: React + TailwindCSS + Headless UI (clean, lightweight, avoids CSS conflicts).
	‚Ä¢	Design system: based on DSV corporate palette (Deep Blue, White, Black).
	‚Ä¢	Architecture: Single-Page Application (SPA), responsive design, PWA-enabled for mobile approvals.
	‚Ä¢	Features:
	‚Ä¢	Role-based dashboards (Requester, Procurement, Approver, Admin).
	‚Ä¢	Modules: MR form, RFQ management, Quote approval, PR/PO workflows, Supplier & Item management, Analytics.
	‚Ä¢	Multi-project support; i18n framework in place for multi-language.

1.2 Backend (API Layer)
	‚Ä¢	Tech: Node.js with NestJS (preferred over raw Express for modularity, dependency injection, Swagger API docs).
	‚Ä¢	Architecture: RESTful APIs (option for GraphQL layer in Phase-2).
	‚Ä¢	Responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Business logic for MR ‚Üí RFQ ‚Üí Quote ‚Üí PR ‚Üí PO transitions.
	‚Ä¢	Approval routing, status management via centralized state machine.
	‚Ä¢	Role-based authorization (RBAC + ABAC).
	‚Ä¢	Audit logging.
	‚Ä¢	Integration endpoints (SSO, e-signature, email service, ERP connectors).

1.3 Database (Persistence Layer)
	‚Ä¢	Tech: PostgreSQL (Supabase for MVP, Aurora Postgres for enterprise scale).
	‚Ä¢	Schema highlights:
	‚Ä¢	Core tables: projects, users, roles, suppliers, items, MRs, RFQs, quotes, PRs, POs, approvals, audit_logs, attachments.
	‚Ä¢	Normalized structure with referential integrity (FK constraints).
	‚Ä¢	Indexed on MRN/PO numbers, supplier names, project IDs.
	‚Ä¢	Security: Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled for project scoping.
	‚Ä¢	Scalability: Supports read replicas for analytics/reporting load.

1.4 File Storage
	‚Ä¢	Tech: Cloud object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Supabase storage).
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Stores photos, PDFs, RFQs, POs, compliance docs.
	‚Ä¢	Access: Presigned URLs (15-min expiry) for uploads/downloads.
	‚Ä¢	Extras: Virus scanning pipeline (ClamAV or service integration).

1.5 Authentication & Authorization
	‚Ä¢	Tech: SSO via SAML/OAuth2 (Azure AD, Okta).
	‚Ä¢	MFA support for enterprise security.
	‚Ä¢	RBAC: Role-based access across modules.
	‚Ä¢	ABAC: Attribute-based rules (e.g., user can only approve PRs in their project and below their threshold).
	‚Ä¢	Authorization matrix: stored per project, editable via Admin UI.

1.6 Integrations
	‚Ä¢	E-signature: DocuSign (primary) or Adobe Sign (alt).
	‚Ä¢	Email service: AWS SES or SendGrid (RFQ/PO dispatch, notifications).
	‚Ä¢	ERP (Phase-2): Integration layer with REST/EDI connectors (SAP, Oracle).
	‚Ä¢	Webhooks: Framework for supplier portal submissions and e-signature callbacks.

1.7 Analytics & Reporting
	‚Ä¢	Data aggregation: DB views + materialized aggregates for KPIs.
	‚Ä¢	APIs: expose metrics to frontend dashboards (Recharts/D3).
	‚Ä¢	Exports: CSV for offline analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Future (Phase-2): OLAP warehouse (BigQuery/Redshift) for advanced analytics.

2. Workflow Handling
	‚Ä¢	Workflow engine: Lightweight service inside backend.
	‚Ä¢	Workflow engine enforces mandatory Quote Approval step. PRs and POs route through multi-step approval matrices based on thresholds.
	‚Ä¢	Transitions: MR ‚Üí RFQ ‚Üí PR ‚Üí PO orchestrated centrally.
	‚Ä¢	State machine: All status enums managed in one config (draft, submitted, approved, rejected).
	‚Ä¢	Approval matrix: Driven by project policies, thresholds, and roles.

3. Data Model Highlights
	‚Ä¢	Material Requests: mrs ‚Üí mr_lines.
	‚Ä¢	RFQs: rfqs ‚Üí rfq_suppliers ‚Üí quotes ‚Üí quote_lines.
	‚Ä¢	Requisitions: prs ‚Üí pr_lines.
	‚Ä¢	Orders: pos ‚Üí po_lines.
	‚Ä¢	Suppliers: suppliers + supplier_history.
	‚Ä¢	Items: items + item_prices.
	‚Ä¢	Approvals: generic table covering MR, PR, PO, Quote Packs.
	‚Ä¢	Audit logs: actor, action, before/after JSON diffs.

4. Cross-Cutting Concerns
	‚Ä¢	Auditability: Immutable audit_logs table.
	‚Ä¢	Notifications: Event queue (RabbitMQ/SQS) for async dispatch; Dead Letter Queue for failures.
	‚Ä¢	Scalability: Stateless API containers (Docker/Kubernetes/ECS); auto-scaling DB replicas.
	‚Ä¢	Security: TLS, encryption at rest, signed URLs for file access.
	‚Ä¢	Config: Admin portal writes into config tables (MR fields, FX rates, thresholds).
	‚Ä¢	Feature flags: Safe rollout of Phase-2+ features.

‚∏ª

5. Deployment & DevOps
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD: GitHub Actions ‚Üí build/test/deploy.
	‚Ä¢	Quality gates: Static code analysis, security scans (ESLint, SonarQube, Dependabot).
	‚Ä¢	Infra as Code: Terraform/CloudFormation for reproducible environments.
	‚Ä¢	Environments: Dev ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Prod.
	‚Ä¢	Hosting:
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Docker containers in Kubernetes/ECS.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Vercel/Netlify for MVP; enterprise on private hosting/VPN.
	‚Ä¢	Database: Managed Postgres (Supabase for MVP; Aurora in enterprise).

6. MVP vs Phase-2 Tech Considerations

MVP (first release)
	‚Ä¢	React frontend (PWA-enabled).

	‚Ä¢	Manual quote entry + CSV upload.
	‚Ä¢	Mobile-first approvals (swipe/approve).
	‚Ä¢	Advanced analytics (OLAP warehouse, custom dashboards).


Phase-2 (scale & differentiation)
	‚Ä¢	AI supplier recommendation (ML service trained on supplier_history).
	‚Ä¢	ERP integrations (SAP/Oracle connectors).
	‚Ä¢	Automated document parsing (OCR/AI microservice).
	‚Ä¢	Multi-language UI rollout.
	‚Ä¢	Embedded e-signature blocks inside PO PDFs.
