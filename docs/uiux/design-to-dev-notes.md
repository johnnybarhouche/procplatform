_Last updated: 2025-01-24_

## Artefact Links
- Wireframes (Story 1.3): `docs/uiux/wireframes/README.md`
- High-Fidelity Mockups (Story 2.3): `docs/uiux/mockups/README.md`
- Design Tokens (Story 1.2): `docs/uiux/design-tokens.md`
- UI Kit Guidelines (Story 2.1): `docs/uiux/ui-kit-notes.md`

## Implementation Checklist
1. Use `AppLayout` shell (top bar, sidebar, bottom nav) for every primary page.
2. Reference UI kit primitives for buttons, inputs, selects, cards, tables, badges, tabs, modals.
3. Apply spacing/typography per tokens (`space-y-5`, `font-size-base`, etc.).
4. Observe annotations in high-fi mockups for responsive behaviours and state handling.
5. Confirm focus-visible outlines and contrast match design spec before handoff.

## Review Summary
- 2025-01-24: PO + Engineering review completed. Adjustments: navigation iconography, bottom nav label spacing, PR dashboard filter alignment.
- All updates applied to Figma v1 (see mockup README).

## Outstanding Items
- Story 2.4 (if planned) should cover dashboard-specific data visual refinements.
- Capture developer questions in this doc as implementation progresses.
