# UI Audit Report — Procurement Application

- **Date:** 2025-01-24
- **Prepared by:** James (Dev Agent)
- **Scope:** Compare current MVP UI implementation (`src/app/page.tsx` and linked components) with the design brief in `docs/front-end.md` and the rollout plan in `docs/uiux-Implementation.md`.
- **Primary Flows Reviewed:** Material Request → RFQ → Quote Approval → Purchase Requisition → Purchase Order, plus Supplier Management, Item Database, Analytics, and Admin configuration.

## 1. Summary & Recommendations

The MVP implements end-to-end screens for every core module, but the experience diverges from the approved design system and navigation patterns:

- Brand alignment is missing — components rely on Tailwind defaults (`bg-white`, `text-gray-*`) instead of DSV colors and typography. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#1-brand-guidelines]
- The global layout uses a temporary top navigation in `src/app/page.tsx` with role switchers; the spec requires a Deep Blue top bar plus persistent left navigation and mobile tab behavior. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#2-global-layout]
- Several high-priority flows lack state coverage (draft vs submitted badges, approval matrices, attachment previews) called out in the design brief. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3-core-user-flows]
- Traceability, accessibility, and cross-cutting UX elements (chips, notification bell, swipe cards) are not implemented.

**Immediate Recommendation:** Address foundational gaps (tokens, navigation shell, shared components) in Sprint 1 before iterating on individual screens. See Section 4 for the prioritized remediation backlog.

## 2. Module-by-Module Findings

### 2.1 Material Request (MR)
- **What Exists:** `MaterialRequestForm.tsx` covers required fields, supports attachments, and auto-selects a project when only one exists.
- **Design Alignment:** Layout uses white cards and gray text; CTAs are Tailwind blue instead of brand Deep Blue/white CTA combo. State chips (Draft/Submitted) and admin-configurable field hints are not surfaced. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.1-material-request-mr]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - No visual differentiation for MR states; should apply grey/blue states per spec.
  - Missing inline traceability or chip linking to downstream PR/PO.
  - Attachments management lacks preview thumbnails or guidance.

### 2.2 Procurement (RFQ)
- **What Exists:** `ProcurementDashboard.tsx` provides MR inbox, supplier suggestions, and action buttons.
- **Design Alignment:** Supplier suggestion panel is present but uses neutral styling; wizard flow (stepper for Select lines → Suggest suppliers → Add manual suppliers → Set terms → Dispatch) is absent — current screen relies on CTA buttons only. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.2-procurement-rfq]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - Missing step-by-step wizard UI; dispatch workflow is not enforced.
  - Quote comparison grid (rows vs suppliers columns) lives elsewhere; not linked from MR inbox.
  - CTA styling inconsistent with brand tokens.

### 2.3 Quote Approval
- **What Exists:** `QuoteApprovalDashboard.tsx` surfaces approvals with status filters and summary cards.
- **Design Alignment:** Radios per line item, split award support, and confirmation modal are not implemented; approval action code paths are commented out. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.3-quote-approval-end-user]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - No per-line award selection; decision workflow incomplete.
  - Lacks confirmation modal and guardrails before submission.
  - UI styles rely on grey palette rather than Deep Blue/brand chips.

### 2.4 Purchase Requisition (PR)
- **What Exists:** `PRDashboard.tsx` (list), `PRDetailView.tsx`, `PRApprovalForm.tsx`.
- **Design Alignment:** Header info displayed but dual currency (AED & USD) formatting is partial; approval matrix view is simplified to status tags without pending approver visualization. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.4-purchase-requisition-pr]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - No explicit approval matrix UI (tables per role/threshold).
  - Audit trail tab missing; activities not surfaced.
  - Approve/Reject/Comment actions exist but rely on generic buttons.

### 2.5 Purchase Order (PO)
- **What Exists:** `PODashboard.tsx`, `PODetailView.tsx`, `POAnalytics.tsx`.
- **Design Alignment:** Status timeline (Draft → Approved → Sent → Acknowledged) is missing; buttons to generate PDF/send supplier are simple text buttons. Supplier-facing PDF styling not represented. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.5-purchase-order-po]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - No timeline component for order states.
  - Missing PDF preview / template styled with Deep Blue header.
  - Multi-step approval flows tied to amount thresholds not surfaced.

### 2.6 Supplier Management
- **What Exists:** `SupplierDashboard.tsx`, `SupplierDetailView.tsx`, `SupplierForm.tsx`.
- **Design Alignment:** Directory table shows suppliers; compliance alerts appear as simple badges without red emphasis. Tabs for contacts/docs/price history exist. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.6-supplier-management]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - Compliance alerts should use red badge styling to match spec.
  - Spend visualization missing; price history chart view is basic.
  - No explicit link to past PO list per supplier.

### 2.7 Item Database
- **What Exists:** `ItemMasterDashboard.tsx`, `ItemDetailView.tsx`, `PriceHistoryChart.tsx`.
- **Design Alignment:** Catalog search works; detail view includes chart but uses default blue line with minimal styling. Top suppliers list exists but does not match spec layout. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.7-item-database]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - Need consistent card layout and Deep Blue chart accents.
  - Traceability chips linking items to MR/PO not implemented.

### 2.8 Analytics Dashboard
- **What Exists:** `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` with KPI cards and Recharts graphs.
- **Design Alignment:** KPI cards exist but use light gray background, not Deep Blue icons; export buttons are plain text. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.8-analytics-dashboard]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - KPI styling should match spec (Deep Blue icon circle, white card background).
  - Export actions need white button with blue outline.
  - Chart colors should align with brand palette.

### 2.9 Admin Configuration
- **What Exists:** `AdminDashboard.tsx` and supporting configuration components for MR fields, authorization matrix, currency, integrations, user management, system settings.
- **Design Alignment:** Functional coverage matches story 1.9, but UI uses white surfaces + gray; no blue border preview for PO templates; configuration panes rely on default forms. [Ref: docs/front-end.md#3.9-admin]
- **Key Gaps:**
  - MR field configurator lacks drag/drop affordance visuals matching spec.
  - Authorization matrix table styling is generic, does not highlight thresholds.
  - PO template preview not implemented; feature defined in spec.

## 3. Brand & Design Token Compliance Review

| Token Category | Spec (DSV) | Current Implementation | Gap Severity |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Primary Colors | Deep Blue `#002664`, White `#FFFFFF`, Black `#000000` | Tailwind `bg-white`, `text-gray-900`, `bg-blue-600`; no custom palette defined | **Critical** |
| Secondary Palette | Green `#00682A`, Orange `#C64801`/`#FFC40C`, Red `#E18375` | Using Tailwind greens/yellows/reds (`bg-green-100`, `bg-yellow-100`, etc.) | **High** |
| Typography | Sans-serif aligned with corporate (Arial/Roboto fallback) | Body uses `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif` via `globals.css`; heading weights mostly Tailwind defaults | **Medium** (needs confirmation of official font asset) |
| Spacing | 8px grid | Tailwind spacing mostly multiples of 4; many components use `p-6` (24px) etc.; need audit to align to 8px tokens | **High** |
| Components | Buttons, Inputs, Tables, Tabs, Cards, Modals | Components rely on Tailwind primitives; tokens not centralized, inconsistent states/hover colors | **Critical** |
| Design Assets | Wireframes, high-fi mockups | Not linked in repo; pending design delivery (Acceptance Criterion 4) | **High** (dependency) |

**Action:** Establish a Tailwind theme extension or design token config mapping the DSV palette/spacing/typography so components can consume consistent classes.

## 4. Prioritized Gap Checklist

| Priority Rank | Flow / Module | Issue | Severity | Owner | Fix Type | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| 1 | Global Shell | Top bar & sidebar not aligned to Deep Blue + left nav spec | Critical | Dev (with design assets) | Layout implementation | `page.tsx` uses white nav; need responsive top/left layout + mobile tabs. |
| 2 | Design Tokens | No centralized tokens for colors/typography/spacing/components | Critical | Design → Dev | Token setup | Create Tailwind config and token documentation matching `docs/front-end.md#1`. |
| 3 | MR → RFQ Flow | Missing wizard experience and state badges | High | Dev | Component updates | Implement stepper, state chips, traceability. |
| 4 | Quote Approval | Line-level award selection & confirmation modal absent | High | Dev | Interaction logic | Reactivate decision flow with per-line radios, modal. |
| 5 | PR / PO Approvals | Approval matrix, PO timeline, multi-step thresholds missing | High | Dev | Component build | Visualize approval chain + status timeline. |
| 6 | PO Templates | No preview wizard in Admin module | High | Design → Dev | New workflow | Provide design for upload → placeholders → preview → publish steps. |
| 7 | Cross-Cutting | Traceability chips, notification bell, mobile swipe approvals not present | Medium | Dev | Component creation | Align with cross-cutting spec section 4. |
| 8 | Accessibility | Contrast & focus states not audited; no evidence of WCAG checks | Medium | Dev | QA/Styling | Validate colors once tokens applied. |
| 9 | Analytics | KPI/Export styling off-brand | Medium | Dev | Styling refresh | Apply brand icons, button treatments. |
| 10 | Supplier Mgmt | Compliance badge styling + spend views incomplete | Medium | Dev | UI update | Add red badges, spend metrics per spec. |
